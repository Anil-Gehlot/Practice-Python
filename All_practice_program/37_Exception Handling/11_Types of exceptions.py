In Python there are 2 types of exceptions are possible : 

1. Predefined Exceptions / In-built exceptions
2. User Definded Exceptions / Customized Exceptions or Programatic Exceptions


1. Predefined Exceptions:
                The exceptions which are raised automatically by Python virtual machine whenver a
particular event occurs, are called pre defined exceptions.

Example:
        print(10/0)    ZeroDivisionError.
        x=int("ten")    ValueError

        
2. User Defined Exceptions:
                Some time we have to define and raise exceptions explicitly to indicate that something
goes wrong ,such type of exceptions are called User Defined Exceptions or Customized
Exceptions.
            Programmer is responsible to define these exceptions and Python not having any idea
about these. Hence we have to raise explicitly based on our requirement by using "raise"
keyword.
